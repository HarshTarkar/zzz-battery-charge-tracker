            <br />
            <p>I made this as a fun project. I might update more things later on as the game progresses. This site does not sync with hoyoverse or ZZZ in any way. It is just for planning and nor is the data saved anywhere.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Some common questions</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>Why are there so many levels?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>So most of the basic materials change on levels 10,20,30,40 etc. but the higher dimensional data(the thing used to upgrade agent core skills) changes on levels 25,35,45 etc. So for example if you select level 40 all the other resources will be of level 40 but higher dimensional data will be of level 35, since you would not have unlocked the level 45.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Where is the disk drive reward?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>Well I added it just to see how much battery charge it requires. Its rewards are really random but I am planning to add them later on.</p>
